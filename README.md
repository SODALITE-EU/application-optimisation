# SODALITE Application Optimizer (MODAK)

The MODAK (Model Optimized Deployment of Applications in Containers) package, a software-defined optimization framework for containerized MPI and AI applications, is the SODALITE component responsible for enabling the static optimization of applications before deployment. It aims to optimize the performance of application deployment to infrastructure in a software-defined way. Automation in application optimization is enabled using performance modeling and container technology. Containers provide an optimized runtime for application deployment based on the target hardware and along with any software dependencies and libraries.
